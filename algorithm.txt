Import random and os.path
Define character variables (name, race, level, current HP, and potions) as characterData
Define the game variables (damage, max HP, hit chance, however many points health potions heal)
Define isDead as false so the character is seen as alive


Define saveCharacter module from characterData:
Open new file to write the first attribute [0] from characterData for the newly created character
This will name the file after whatever the user names his/her character
Close the file


Define loadCharacter module from characterName:
Opens new file to write the characterName inputted by the user to find if the text file exists
If it does,it loads the character and reads it
Close the file
Then it takes the characterData from the loaded file and assigns the modifiers as they were for that character


Define assignRaceModifiers module from race:
If statement to define if human is picked to change the starting attributes to the modified attributes
Elif statement to define if Elf is picked to “                                                                                                        “
Elif statement to define if Dwarf is picked to “                                                                                                  “
Elif statement to define if Hobbit is picked to “                                                                                                 “


Define createCharacterMenu module:
Made a fancy menu for the user to create the name for his/her character
While True:
Another fancy menu for the user to pick a race
If and elif statements to assign the correct characterData to the player’s file for whichever race is selected

Assign the max HP
And run the saveCharacter module

Create if statement for the create new character that runs createCharacterMenu() and battle() once finished

Else statement if the character you entered doesn’t exist
Elif statement to quit the program if 3 is entered


Define battle module:
Make sure isDead is false so your character alive

If statement for the random chance to hit the orc
Else for if you miss, which you will…
Elif for if you want to drink a potion, or 2, or 3

Elif for if the user wants to save and quit
Else statement in case the user enters an invalid option
